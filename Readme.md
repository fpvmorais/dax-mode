# DAX Mode for Emacs

This is the first version of the mode that let's you edit the DAX language in your favourite editor.

Also included is a `dax-pretty-print` function that uses http://www.daxformatter.com/api/daxformatter/DaxFormat/ to beautify your code.

## Installation

Just clone this repo to `emacs.d` and place the code below in your `init.el`:

``` emacs-lisp
(load "~/.emacs.d/dax-mode/dax-mode.el")
```
